# My_TensorFlow

Hello there!

Welcome to my Tensorflow 'Playground'. I will be doing a lot of hands on code practice with Tensorflow (which happens to be my favourite Machine Learning Library).
I will be exploring some advanced techniques in tnesorflow. More like, customised techniques that allow flexibility in building models and training artificial neural networks!

Commits will be made as techniques are learned.

As much as possible, I will give details in my notebooks about each commit as I update stage my changes.

I hope you have an interesting time going through this repository
